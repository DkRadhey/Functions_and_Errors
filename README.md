# Functions_and_Errors
This solidity program is to demonstrate the functioning of error handling functions in solidity. Use of revert(), require() and assert() is demonstrated in this program.

# Execution
In this program there is a variable of data type mapping named balances to keep a track of balance in the account. Secondly there are three functions:

# 1st function (deposit)
To deposit some amount in the account i.e address and amount. We used require() method to handle errors in this function.

# 2nd function (withdraw)
To withdraw some amount from the account, used revert method to handle errors in this function.

# 3rd function (transfers)
Taking three arguments, address1, address2 and the amount to be transferred from address1 to address2, and used assert method to handle errors.
